                Discussions based on current researches that are facilitated by
                students, faculty members, or industry representatives.
                Students are expected to provide a written summary of each
                discussed research paper and to participate in-class discussion.
                Each student facilitates the discussion at least once during
                the semester. The impact of the research in a global and
                societal context will be discussed.

                  C.E.M. Joad wrote <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Teach_Yourself_Philosophy.html?id=EeOxGAAACAAJ">Teach Yourself Philosophy</a> in 1944. His
                    advice can be applied to reading scientific papers. He
                    says:
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  <em>Make judicious selection</em>. In philosophy Joad says "Never
                    try to read a whole book at once." In our case, do not try
                    to read all the papers on a subject at once. Joad says
                    "pick out certain chapters, two or three perhaps, which
                    deal with matters that seem to you to be of particular
                    importance or which relate to topics on which you have
                    already read something." We need to pick out those papers
                    that are of most importance to the problem in hand. Of
                    philosophy books, Joad says "Use the introduction and
                    preface to help you identify these." In our case, we need
                    to use something else to determine which papers we should
                    attend to. See Fred Brooks' note (above) for more on that.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  <em>Indulge in intelligent skipping</em>. You do not have to
                  read everything. You do not need to read every word of every
                  paper. Do not be embarrassed to skip. You cannot possibly
                  read every paper in the world; you need to ensure that the
                  ones you spend your time on are the important ones. For some
                  papers you need only look at the introduction and conclusion,
                  with a glance elsewhere. For some, you will need to read the
                  whole thing, but maybe not today. Joad says "omit the
                  unintelligible; skip the repetitions; jump over the boring
                  bits". You are allowed to do this!

                  </p>

                  <p>
                  <em>Ensure you understand</em>. Joad says stop reading when
                  you stop understanding, but he also says to interpret
                  "understand" generously. If you do not understand, there is
                  sometimes point in pressing on a little further to see if it
                  becomes clear, but if you really do not get it, there is no
                  point in reading on for the sake of reading on. You need to
                  stop and say "why do I not understand?"; "is this important
                  enough that I need to learn something else so that I can
                  understand?"

                  </p>
                              
                  <p>
                  <em>Make notes</em>. The process of writing notes helps
                  enormously with remembering. The process of having to
                  summarise someone else's work helps enormously with
                  understanding. <!--Exercise 1 asks you to precise the content of 
                  a
                  four page paper in just one page. This is a great skill to
                  have. --> Also you need to ensure that you have made good enough
                  notes that you will be able to find any paper again in two
                  years time when it turns out to be important. Too many times
                  have I heard the cry "I know that I have read a paper on
                  exactly this problem, but I cannot remember where!"

                  <p>
                  The starting research student assumes that all research
                  papers are well-written and describe good research that is
                  both correct and important. <em>This is not true</em>.  
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Research papers can report <em>poor research</em>. The review
                  process is supposed to prevent this, but it is not a perfect
                  process and there is a fair amount of published work out
                  there that is not good. The publication venue is a guide to
                  likely quality. A top-rank journal or conference is unlikely
                  to publish poor research, because the review process is
                  fierce.  A lower-rank journal or conference is more likely to
                  let poor research through.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Published research is supposed to be correct. However, there
                  are cases where the authors and reviewers have honestly
                  failed to notice that their data, assumptions, proofs, or
                  conclusions are <em>wrong</em>.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  A big mistake made by many new researchers is to think that
                  every single paper is important. Of course, it was important
                  to the authors, but it may well be reporting on a dead end, a
                  trivial result, a system that does not work well, or an idea
                  that has been superseded. So you will find that many papers
                  are <em>unimportant</em>, at least with respect to your
                  particular research area.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Even if a paper is good research, correct, and important, it
                  may <em>not be well written</em>. Sadly, there are some
                  papers that are incomprehensible. It is wrong to assume that
                  the authors are trying to hide something in their poor
                  writing, though this may be the case. Often it is just poor
                  writing skills.
